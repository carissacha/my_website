            <p>Hi! I’m Carissa Chan, a second-year student studying Data Science and Finance. I’m originally from Hong Kong but currently based in Boston for school.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I love staying active—whether it's yoga, pilates, dancing, or playing golf in the summer. I spend a lot of time at the gym and enjoy pushing myself to improve. Cooking is another big passion of mine; I love experimenting with new recipes and trying different flavors.</p>
            <p>I also have a creative side and enjoy drawing, especially portraits and landscapes. Traveling is something I really value, whether it’s visiting new places or going back home to see family. I’m also passionate about community service and have been involved in various initiatives over the years.</p>
            <p>Overall, I love staying busy, learning new things, and surrounding myself with great people!</p>
